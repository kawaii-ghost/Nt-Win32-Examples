# Nt-Win32-Examples
Source code examples while me learning Windows System Programming


System calls can be grouped roughly into six major categories

- 1. Process control
- 2. File management
- 3. Device management
- 4. Information maintenance
- 5. Communication
- 6. Protection
 
 I made also the Native API version so I can understand both of Native API and Win32 API.

Currently, I'm studying about File Management so just wait, cause I learn it as a hobby as I need to prioritize school first.
